The delineation here seems more geopolitical than historical and I am curious as to why that is significant in this study, much less the distinction of whiteness to include the Germanic and Irish people who were at one time, not considered white but ""swarthy"". Why now are these arbitrary delineations changing, especially in a scientific perspective not only to broaden the inclusivity of whiteness, but to further stratify racialized groups? I would find it very interesting if you included both this common legal stratification of ""race/origin"" as well as one which is explicitly self-identified by each participant, to see the differences between how participants perceive their own identity and how they believe their identity is perceived through a legal framework, as per my own example.","English,Spanish",,Junior (Third Year),,"It is required by my major.,Other:",Statistics are often misused under the profit motive to justify exploitation in many forms.
