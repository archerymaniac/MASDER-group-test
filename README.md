# MASDER-group-test
This is a test to see how the MASDER team can work together


just to let everyone know how to undo a change



If you would like to undo a commit and revert back you want to find the SHA code that is in the commit tab in R. From here click the history button and click the version you would like to revert to. When you click it you should see it says SHA and its a long string or code. Copy this code and then open up a terminal in R. To do so hit tools then new terminal. Then once its open type in: git reset --hard SHA   where the SHA is the code up copied earlier. When you hit enter it should revert back to the previous version.
